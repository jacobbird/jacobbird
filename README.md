Hello my name is Jacob and I have been coding for 15 years. I have focused on web application and proudly graduated Cum Laude with a degree in Computer Science. 
However, my first degree was in Physics alumned in 2003. I find that programming can be rewarding. I hope you like what you've found here even though these projects are not finished products. This should give you enough to know what I've been up to. Thanks for looking bye now.
